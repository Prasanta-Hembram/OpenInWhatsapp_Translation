This is the same as clicking an unknown number on a group, creating manually the url link or saving the contact. 'Why should I use this instead of others?' You are free to choose of course! This app only has the 'open in WhatsApp' feature and improvements, but for this reason the app is extremely simple and so I made it without ads, as small a possible, and free; just to help others use this feature that WhatsApp have (note that I'm not affiliated with WhatsApp Inc). Since I published it the popularity increased as unexpected (thanks!) and other apps with the same functionality (some even blatant copies without my permission) have populated the store. You can use whichever you prefer, but this one is (last time I checked at least) the smallest of all, the only one add-free, and the only one without 'dangerous' permissions (not internet, not storage, nothing. Check it! ). ------------------- This app uses WhatsApp 'click to chat' feature (https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000030/) to open a chat with any number (a chat between you and that number). No contact is created on the device, you don't need to save it on your contacts list. Just open the app, enter the number, click the button and the chat will open (if the number doesn't exists WhatsApp will notify it). Useful on situations like: - Someone called you and you want to contact it via WhatsApp? - You need to send a message to someone but you don't want to save it? - You want to start a chat with yourself? Prefix: You need to specify the prefix of the number, even if from your own country (will be kept when reopening the app). You can enter it manually or tap the + button to choose from a list. Create links: You can create an url link that will open WhatsApp on the specified number. This is a WhatsApp feature, you don't need this app to open the link, only to create it. You can also add a message that will be autocompleted (will NOT, I repeat, will NOT be sent, the user must press the send button manually). If you specify a message but not a number WhatsApp will ask who to send it to (again, will NOT be sent, only autocompleted). You can save the link as a quick shortcut, share it so people can contact you (the number is visible on the link, be careful), set a predefined message on a site to 'share it on WhatsApp', etc. Remember, you don't need this app to open the link, it is handled by WhatsApp. Hidden shortcut: long tap the 'share' button to quickly copy the link to the clipboard. Recents list: When a number is opened it is saved on a recents list, in case you want to open a number again and you don't remember the number. You can also pin numbers and name them, or even create shortcuts. --------------------------- This is a tool app: simple and lightweight. No extra features, no extra size, no dangerous permissions, no ads...just the open-in-WhatsApp feature (with each update I add a little related feature, but I want to keep it as simple and lightweight as possible).
